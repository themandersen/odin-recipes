    <h2>What is a burrito casserole?</h2>

    <p>
      Seasoned rice, shredded chicken, beans, salsa verde, and cheese are layered in a casserole<br>
      dish and baked until perfectly melty. Cut them into small, medium, or generous portions,<br>
      and leftovers, if any, reheat beautifully.
    </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, combine the chili powder, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, ground cumin,<br>
        and salt. You will use half of it to season the chicken and the other half in the rice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the chicken breasts on a large plate and use one hand to rub 1 teaspoon olive oil all<br>
        over them. Sprinkle them with about half of the seasoning mix. Set it aside while you make the rice. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the rice<br>
        and the remaining seasoning mix. Cook stirring continuously for about 2 minutes, until the<br>
        rice is lightly toasted.<br>
        <br>
        Stir in the chicken stock, green chilis, and tomato paste. Place the chicken breasts (make<br>
        sure to get all the tasty seasoning stuck to the plate too) on top of the rice. Increase the<br>
        heat to medium-high. As soon as it comes up to a boil, reduce the heat to low and cover the<br>
        skillet with a lid. Cook for 20 to 25 minutes, until chicken is cooked through and the rice is tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the chicken breasts onto a large plate and shred them into bite-sized pieces using<br>
        two forks or your hands (you may need to wait for it to cool down a bit).<br>
        <br>
        Give the rice a stir, taste, and season with more salt if desired. Add about 2 tablespoons<br>
        of chicken stock if the rice looks dry and needs more liquid.
      </li>
      <li>
        In an 8 x 8-inch or 9 x 9-inch baking dish, spread 1/4 cup salsa verde. Layer one tortilla<br>
        on top, trimming it as needed to cover the dish. Evenly spread a layer of half each of the<br>
        beans, rice, and chicken. Sprinkle with 3/4 cup cheese and 1/2 cup salsa verde.<br>
        <br>
        Repeat with another layer of tortilla and the remaining beans, rice, chicken, 3/4 cup cheese,<br>
        and 1/2 cup salsa. Add a final layer of tortilla and top it with 1/4 cup salsa verde and 1/2 cup cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the baking dish tightly with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for<br>
        an additional 8 to 10 minutes, until the cheese is melted.<br>
        <br>
        Serve it with optional toppings like sour cream, chopped cilantro, shredded lettuce, diced<br>
        avocados, and chopped tomatoes.
      </li>
    </ol>
