    <h2>Why are you going to love this drink?</h2>

    <p>
      Horchata is the perfect blend of sweet and creamy. It has a deliciously refreshing flavor that<br>
      is perfect for hot summer days. Its sweetness comes primarily from the sweetened condensed milk,<br>
      while the creaminess mostly comes from the ground rice and cinnamon used in its preparation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Horchata is often regarded as a healthier alternative to other sweet drinks, such as soda or<br>
      fruit juices, as it is made with natural ingredients and contains less sugar and fewer calories.<br>
      However that may not be the case with this amazing recipe.
    </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Soak the rice and cinnamon in the hot water for at least 8 hours, over night is best.</li>
      <li>Once soaking is finished put the rice, cinnamon, and water mixture in a blender and puree.</li>
      <li>
        Arriving at a smooth puree you now need to strain the mixture using a fine strainer and a<br>
        single layer of cheese cloth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now in a tall glass pitcher combine the pureed rice cinnamon mixture with 4 cups of room<br>
        temperature water. Stir in both cans of milk (sweetened condensed and evaporated). Finish<br>
        it off by stirring in the fresh whole milk and vanilla until it is all smooth and consistent.
      </li>
      <li>Pour the horchata into a glass and add ice if you like it cold.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle a small amount of cinnamon powder on the ice for a bit of ambiance.</li>
