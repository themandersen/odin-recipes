    <h2>Why are you going to love this drink?</h2>

    <p>
      Horchata is the perfect blend of sweet and creamy. It has a deliciously refreshing flavor that<br>
      is perfect for hot summer days. Its sweetness comes primarily from the sweetened condensed milk,<br>
      while the creaminess mostly comes from the ground rice and cinnamon used in its preparation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Horchata is often regarded as a healthier alternative to other sweet drinks, such as soda or<br>
      fruit juices, as it is made with natural ingredients and contains less sugar and fewer calories.<br>
      However that may not be the case with this amazing recipe.
