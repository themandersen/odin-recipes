    <h2>What makes this banana bread so amazing?</h2>

    <p>
      The beauty of this banana bread recipe is you don't need a fancy mixer! A mixing bowl, a fork<br>
      to whisk the eggs, and a sturdy spoon to mix the batter are all you need. The sugar amount is<br>
      flexible. The original recipe called for a cup of white sugar, but most people, including me, do<br>
      just fine with 3/4 cup, and many are happy with 1/2 cup.
    </p>

    <p>
      It really is the best banana bread recipe, period. You can mix everything in one bowl, you can<br>
      vary the amount of sugar or bananas. And the secret to its great flavor? <strong>Melted butter</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350째F (175째C), and butter an 8 x 4-inch loaf pan.</li>
      <li>
        In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until completely smooth. Stir the melted butter<br>
        into the mashed bananas.
      </li>
      <li>Mix in the baking soda and salt. Stir in the sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract. Mix in the flour.</li>
      <li>Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan.</li>
      <li>
        Bake for 55 to 65 minutes at 350째F (175째C), or until a toothpick or wooden skewer inserted into<br>
        the center comes out clean. A few dry crumbs are okay; streaks of wet batter are not. If the<br>
        outside of the loaf is browned but the center is still wet, loosely tent the loaf with foil and<br>
        continue baking until the loaf is fully baked.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for a few minutes. Then remove the banana bread from<br>
        the pan and let cool completely before serving. Slice and serve. (A bread knife helps to make<br>
        slices that aren't crumbly.)
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>2 to 3 medium (7" to 7-7/8" long) very ripe bananas, peeled (about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups mashed)</li>
